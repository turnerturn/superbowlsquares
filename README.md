This is designed as a static html page which uses javascript's localstorage feature to provide a automated solution on generating super bowl squares in your next event!  

## Usage
- Click the "Create Board" to start a new game and to clear any remnants of memory from old sessions.
Values 0 to 9 will be randomly distributed to column 1 of the grid for the home team.  Likewise, values 0 to 9 will be randomly distributed to row 1 of the grid for away team.

- Click "Purchase Squares" any time someone desires to make a transaction.  A total of 100 squares are available for purchase.
- Click "Distribute Squares" when you are ready to randomly assign everyone's purchased squares to the grid.
- Squares should not be distributed until after all desired squares are purchased.  You will no longer be able to purchase squares after squares are distributed.
- Click "Print" and then print as pdf to save your results to a digital copy.  This can prevent any unintended memory loss.
